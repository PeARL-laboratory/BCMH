The Bach Chorales Melody-Harmony Corpus

The Bach Chorales Melody-Harmony (BCMH) Corpus consists of homorhythmic, harmonic-melodic reductions of 100 Bach chorales from the Breitkopf & HÃ¤rtel edition. Original symbolic encodings of all chorales were imported and modified from KernScores (kern.ccarh.org). 

In addition to the reduction, we encoded key and Roman numeral annotations as a separate spine using a variant of the Perl-compatible regular expression syntax developed by Neuwirth et al. (2018).
